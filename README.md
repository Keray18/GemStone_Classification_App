## 1. Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the Gemstone Classification project, detailing the purpose, dataset used, dependencies, and instructions for installation and running the application.

## 2. Project Overview
The Gemstone Classification project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and classify gemstones based on their visual characteristics. This project utilizes image data of various gemstones to train a machine learning model, which can then predict the type or class of a given gemstone image.

The primary goals of this project are:

To provide a user-friendly interface for gemstone classification.

## 3. Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the Gemstone Classification model consists of high-quality images of different gemstone types. This dataset contains 3,200+ images of different gemstones. The images are grouped into 87 classes which are already divided into train and test data.
