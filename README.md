**1. Introduction**
This documentation provides an overview of the Gemstone Classification project, detailing the purpose, dataset used, dependencies, and instructions for installation and running the application.

**2. Project Overview**
The Gemstone Classification project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and classify gemstones based on their visual characteristics. This project utilizes image data of various gemstones to train a machine learning model, which can then predict the type or class of a given gemstone image.

The primary goals of this project are:

To build a gemstone classification model capable of accurately identifying gemstones from images.
To provide a user-friendly interface for gemstone classification.
3. Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the Gemstone Classification model consists of high-quality images of different gemstone types. Each image in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding gemstone type. The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

Please note that the dataset used in this project is not included in this documentation. It is advisable to obtain a similar dataset for your project. You can find gemstone image datasets from various online sources or create your own.

**4. Dependencies**
Before running the Gemstone Classification application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

```
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
TensorFlow (version 2.x)
Keras (version 2.x)
OpenCV (version 4.x)
Flask (version 2.x)
Numpy (version 1.x)
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
```

You can install these dependencies using pip, Python's package manager.
